This energy monitor was inspired by and uses a lot of the code written by the people over OkDO, who created the original version of this energy monitor. You can head over to their repo here: https://github.com/LetsOKdo/arduino-power-meter/ to learn more and check out their original code.  

We've adapted the arduino code you'll find in this repo to suit our particular needs, especially when it comes to the arduino board we were using (a custom board "Barduino 4.0" developed by the Fablab Barcelona) and it's particular bitrate of 4095 and for which current transformer we used ( 100v over 5A)

We hope you enjoy! :D
